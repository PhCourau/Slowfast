# Slowfast
The Maruyama files uses a very crude Euler-Maruyama method to simulate L coupled Wright-Fisher diffusions on [0,1]. The save_sims.py file generates one run and saves the result. The plot_timescales.py file reads the corresponding file and finds one segregating locus, to make a figure comparing the fast dynamics of the trait with the slow dynamics of a gene.
